# BIJG-Learning

## University of Missouri Spring 2021 Capstone Project

Our project is a simulation game written in python utilizing the Python Arcade Library. 

The simulation involves randomly generated creatures with various traits such as speed, attack, and health that must fight other creatures and out compete them for food. Creatures can reproduce when they reach a high enough hp. Additionally, there plains, desert, and mountain biomes that affect creatures speed and tendency to be on those biomes based on their traits.
In the simulation users can adjust parameters that affects how the simulation plays out. 

Creatures are controlled by an AI created by the team the controls creatures through wandering throughout the map, sight of food or creatures, and the creatures current location. The creature will make decision based on it's aggression, vision, and affinity for certain biomes.

Given enough time, the simulation will produce optimized creatures for the given constraints (map and modifiers).

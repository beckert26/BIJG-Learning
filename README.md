Our project is a simulation game written in python utilizing the Python Arcade Library. 

The simulation involves a randomly generated world and creatures with various traits such as speed, attack, and health that must fight other creatures and out compete them for food. Creatures can reproduce when they reach a high enough fullness and will mutate slightly from their parents. Additionally, are biomes (plains, desert, mountains) that affect creatures speed and tendency travel on those biomes based on their traits.

In the simulation users can modify simulation parameters that affects how the simulation results in. 

Creatures are controlled by an AI created by the team. Creatures will wander throughout the map in a search for food or other creatures. If the creature "sees" food or other creatures based on its sight attribute the creature will attack or defend based on their aggression trait. Additionally, creatures will search for food more often in biomes they have high affinity for.

Given enough time, the simulation will produce optimized creatures for their environment.
